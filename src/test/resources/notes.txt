For headless from maven:
mvn clean -D"cucumber.filter.tags"="@youtube90" -D"headless"="true" -D"test"="YoutubeRunner.java" test



run this command

mvn clean -D"cucumber.options"="--tags @youtube" -D"buildrunner"="YoutubeRunner.java" test

or

mvn clean -D"cucumber.options"="--tags @youtube" -D"buildrunner"="YoutubeRunner.java" verify

for tags use below Now after updating versions:

 mvn clean -D"cucumber.filter.tags"="@youtube" -D"buildrunner"="YoutubeRunner.java" verify

 OR

  mvn clean -D"cucumber.filter.tags"="@youtube" -D"buildrunner"="YoutubeRunner.java" verify

  For above buildrunner variable we need to add: in  pom.xml

  <includes>
                          <include>${buildrunner}</include>

                      </includes>


OR OR OR....


mvn clean -D"cucumber.filter.tags"="@youtube" -D"test"="YoutubeRunner.java" test

with below maven sure fire plugins...

            <plugin>
                    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
                    <version>3.0.0-M7</version>
                <configuration>
                    <parallel>methods</parallel>
                    <threadCount>2</threadCount>
                    <perCoreThreadCount>true</perCoreThreadCount>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>


Here, below is optional:
<includes>
                        <include>${buildrunner}</include>

                    </includes>


                    if we include buildrunner it will accept both ways.. mvn clean -Dbuildrunner as well as -Dtest params...

also check for @BeforeSuite class in YoutubeRunner.java



ADDING RETRY of failed scenario:
Initialization of driver is kept in Given logic instead of Constructor... you can also put in Constructor as previous.
Just trying this approach so that if we have multiple stepdef classes we dont want to initialize and open browser if we dont require it...
Again it won't affect testing, if we put that logic in Constructor...

Added RetrySteps user_clicks_somewhere2() where it is forced failed or passed depending on constant.
This is for demo purpose only in actual scenario if test case fail it will generate rerun.txt and it will run in next RunnerFile.

For this we want to force fail at first and in FailedRetryRunner we want to pass it as a demo.

How it works.
RetryRunner will set constant to true that will force fail step. and will generate rerun.txt. see details on this java class for config and plugins.
Next step would be Run FailedRetryRunner.java that will pickup rerun.txt see details on java class.
We are storing in different folder for cucumber.json so previous is not overwritten.

For generating combined report do like this...
for first: run via commandline: mvn test -D"buildrunner"="RetryRunner.java"
2nd step: mvn verify -D"buildrunner"="FailedRetryRunner.java"

in actual scenario if first run does not fail any step then running 2nd step will do nothing, so it won't impact results.

Adjust these steps in jenks as well. see screenshot from jenkins config....

Screenshot added after validating... Build status is shown failed eventhough everything is Okay. This is current issue with cucumber...
Results are okay!!!!
