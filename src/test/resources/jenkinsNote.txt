For Windows Jenkis, install powershell script plugin

add config as in PowerShell_Jenkins_Setpu_windos10.png

No mandatory to add verify as mvn goal (in both linux or windows jenkins), since we are using cucumber report as post-build actions.
it will add as long as .json file is generated in target folder.

mvn verify will generate cucumber report for local purpose only...

adding verify won't affect jenkin generating report since we are using separate like plugin POST Build action
